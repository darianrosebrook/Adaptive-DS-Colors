### Key Colors
<!-- -- be able to remove the color -->
- be able to lock the color
- add bulk set of colors based on hex, comma separated

### Test results
<!-- -- Print color results as a vertical auto layout frame, 24px gap -->
<!-- --- Color swatch, named to the color style, 256 X 128, 4px rounded corner -->
<!-- --- color name and stop, text node  -->
<!-- --- color hex code  -->

### Removing a swatch
<!-- - when removing a swatch, the color stop name isn't synced anymore. -->

### Nice to haves
- Remove Redux, not really doing much in this small of a plugin
- Tooltips to describe each section
- Additional color to check contrast against
-- reference that in the style description
